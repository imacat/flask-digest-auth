Flask HTTP Digest Authentication
================================


Description
===========

*Flask-Digest-Auth* is an HTTP Digest Authentication implementation
for Flask_ applications.  It authenticates the user for the protected
views.  It works with Flask-Login_, so that log in protection can be
separated with the log in mechanism.  You can write Flask modules that
work with different log in mechanisms.
